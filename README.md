# sock2
An extension for NetLogo allowing socket-based communication between Netlogo and Clojure/Java.

You'll need to copy [the NetLogo JAR](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/releases/tag/5.0.4) at a compatible version and [a compatible Scala JAR](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala-library/2.10.3) into the `lib` folder.
