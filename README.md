# sock2
An extension for NetLogo allowing socket-based communication between Netlogo and Clojure/Java.

You'll need to copy [the NetLogo JAR](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/releases/tag/5.0.4) at a compatible version and [a compatible Scala JAR](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala-library/2.10.3) into the `lib` folder.

## Stable Version

The last known stable version is located externally [here](http://s573859921.websitehome.co.uk/pub/netlogo/cogs_nl_tools.htm#sock2). This should be used in preference to this development version for new projects.
